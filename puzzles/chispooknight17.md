Challenge description coming soon...

## Clue #1: Radial Ruins
I'm hiding in a Gold Oldsmobile
Cast a radial spell for the ghoulish reveal
I haunt students, children, and elders, all
Start looking near IIT's Hermann Hall

## Clue #2: Cursed Goats
My curse may have been lifted, but I'll never stop haunting the Cubs.

## Clue #3: Spooky Sounds
I'm the thing that goes UNK in the night

## Clue #4: School Spirit
I may not be in Rogers Park, but I'll always have school pride

## Clue #5: Pawar's Poltergeist
The only thing that scares Ameya Pawar more than me is Citizens United.
